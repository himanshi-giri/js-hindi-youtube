 // DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FILTER() , MAP() AND FOREACH()
 //1) FILTER():- Creates a new array with only the elements that pass a specified condition (i.e., the ones for which the function returns true
 //2)MAP():- Creates a new array by applying a specified function to each element in the original array, transforming each element.
 //3)FOREACH():- Returns: undefined. It doesnâ€™t return a new array, as it is designed solely for iteration.
